This project is a simple ETL Pipeline that uses the data from [Brawl Stars Developer API](https://developer.brawlstars.com/).<br>
I'm a [Supercell](https://supercell.com/en/) fan and then I decided to develop this small project using [Brawl Stars](https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/) thematic, of course respecting Supercell's [Fan Content Policy](http://www.supercell.com/fan-content-policy). By the way, the content of this repository is not affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored, or specifically approved by Supercell and they are not responsible for it.<br>
